# V3.7 Architecture

SuperLocalMemory combines a local canonical memory store, multi-channel
retrieval, lifecycle and learning controls, Optimize, Mesh, and MCP/CLI/IDE
surfaces. It is an operator-controlled memory runtime rather than a single
vector index.

## Hybrid Retrieval

Current recall uses five candidate producers where their dependencies are
available, then applies fusion, optional reranking, and graph-based score
enhancement:

```
Query
  │
  ├─ Strategy Classification (single-hop / multi-hop / temporal / open-domain)
  │
  ├─ Candidate Producers:
  │  ├─ Dense semantic
  │  ├─ BM25 lexical
  │  ├─ Temporal
  │  ├─ Hopfield associative
  │  └─ Spreading activation
  │
  ├─ Profile Lookup (direct SQL shortcut for entity queries)
  │
  ├─ Weighted RRF Fusion (k=60, channel weights vary by query type)
  │
  ├─ Scene Expansion (pull all facts from matched scenes)
  │
  ├─ Bridge Discovery (multi-hop only: Steiner tree + spreading activation)
  │
  ├─ Optional cross-encoder rerank when available
  ├─ Graph-derived score enhancement (cannot introduce a candidate)
  │
  └─ Top-K Results with per-channel scores
```

### Why multiple producers?

| Channel | What It Catches | What It Misses |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| Semantic | Meaning similarity | Exact keywords, entity names |
| BM25 | Exact terms, rare words | Paraphrases, synonyms |
| Hopfield associative | Distributed associative similarity | Exact-term-only relationships |
| Temporal | Time-relevant facts | Atemporal knowledge |
| Spreading activation | Linked graph neighborhoods | Isolated facts |

No single channel handles all query types. The fusion combines their strengths.

## Safe context injection

Recalled memory is untrusted evidence, not a new instruction source. Hooks, MCP
`session_init`, CLI session context, and chat use one renderer for provenance,
budgets, recognized-secret redaction, canonical delimiters, and forged-marker
neutralization. IDE rule files contain only static product protocol; dynamic
memory is retrieved through MCP at runtime.

---

## Three Operating Modes

| Mode | Description | LLM | Compliance status |
|:----:|:-----------|:---:|:------------------|
| **A: Local Guardian** | Core memory operations use the local data root. Optional integrations have separate network behavior. | None | Deployment assessment required |
| **B: Smart Local** | Mode A + operator-configured Ollama extraction. | Local | Deployment assessment required |
| **C: Full Power** | Mode B + cloud-provider calls and agentic retrieval. | Cloud | Deployment and provider assessment required |

Mode A runs the core memory path without a cloud model provider. Retrieval quality depends on the configured embedding model, corpus, and enabled indexes; this page makes no market-uniqueness claim.

---

## Seven-stage execution model

SLM uses seven logical stages to make the product inspectable from a write to
an agent-facing recall. They are not seven services and they do not imply that
every optional backend is active for every request.

| Stage | Responsibility | Inspect with |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Admission | Actor, profile/scope, source identity, idempotency, raw evidence | `remember --json`, MCP write receipt |
| 2. Queryable core | Transactional SQLite fact + FTS checkpoint | receipt `materialization_state` |
| 3. Enrichment | Fact/entity/scene/graph/temporal/provenance/embedding derivations | operation status and daemon logs |
| 4. Brain and lifecycle | Consolidation, feedback/outcomes, patterns, rewards, forgetting and retention | Brain, Health and Operations workspaces |
| 5. Retrieval | Candidate producers, fusion, optional rerank and graph scoring | `slm trace` |
| 6. Context safety | Scope/policy, secret redaction, provenance, budgeted untrusted renderer | session/MCP context output |
| 7. Operations | Backups, audit, daemon, Scale Engine, cache/compression and Mesh | `slm doctor`, dashboard, diagnostics |

## Durable Ingestion Pipeline

Every accepted write owns an M018 operation and immutable replay identity.

| State | Contract |
|:----:|:------------|
| `raw` | Raw content, metadata, scope, session context, and trusted actor are durable. |
| `queryable` | Relational facts and SQLite FTS are committed before the receipt returns. |
| `enriching` | A lease-owning worker runs the configured extraction, entity, consolidation, graph, temporal, provenance, and embedding stages. |
| checkpoint | Final fact IDs and completed derivation stages commit before optional projectors. |
| `complete` | Every declared derivation and configured projector succeeded. |
| `failed` | Raw evidence, error, attempt count, and retry timing remain inspectable. |

---

## Database Schema

V3 uses an additive SQLite schema with FTS5 full-text search. The exact table count changes with forward migrations and is not a compatibility contract.

**Core:** `profiles`, `memories`, `atomic_facts`, `atomic_facts_fts` (FTS5)
**Entities:** `canonical_entities`, `entity_aliases`, `entity_profiles`
**Graph:** `graph_edges`, `memory_scenes`, `temporal_events`
**Quality:** `consolidation_log`, `trust_scores`, `provenance`
**Learning:** `feedback_records`, `behavioral_patterns`, `action_outcomes`
**Compliance:** `compliance_audit`
**Infrastructure:** `ingestion_operations`, `config`, `schema_version`, migration records

Core data tables are profile-scoped. M017 adds scope to CCQ blocks; M018 owns canonical ingestion operations. The legacy `pending.db` spool is an offline compatibility input whose replay submits through M018.

### Canonical store and Scale Engine

SQLite and sqlite-vec are the canonical store. CozoDB (graph) and LanceDB
(vector) are derived Scale Engine projections; they do not replace the
canonical database on installation. The supported activation sequence is:

```bash
slm db scale prepare
slm db scale verify <stage-id>
slm db scale promote <stage-id>
# If needed:
slm db scale rollback <backup-id>
```

Prepare builds private projections, verify compares them against the active
SQLite source, promote takes an explicit rollback point, and rollback restores
that named point. This is a correctness control, not a published throughput or
memory-count guarantee.

## Dashboard and operational workspaces

```bash
slm dashboard    # Opens at http://localhost:8765
```

<details open>
<summary><strong>V3 Dashboard</strong></summary>

![Dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qualixar/superlocalmemory/main/docs/screenshots/01-dashboard-main.png)

<table><tr>
<td><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qualixar/superlocalmemory/main/docs/screenshots/04-recall-lab.png" width="280"/></td>
<td><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qualixar/superlocalmemory/main/docs/screenshots/03-math-health.png" width="280"/></td>
</tr></table>

</details>

The dashboard exposes Dashboard, Brain, Knowledge Graph, Memories, Health,
Operations, Entity Explorer, Skill Evolution, Mesh Peers, Settings, and
Optimize workspaces. Some data is mode- or configuration-dependent. A visible
panel means the API surface is available; use CLI/MCP traces for deployment
verification.

## Benchmarks

Evaluated on the [LoCoMo benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09714) — 10 multi-session conversations, 1,986 total questions.

These are historical paper experiments, not current V3.7 measurements:

- Historical V3 research result: **74.8%** used local retrieval with GPT-4.1-mini answer construction.
- Historical Mode C result: **87.7%** on **81 questions from one conversation** with cloud-assisted components.
- The raw zero-LLM and category results remain documented in the versioned paper and must not be compared with other vendors without matching protocols.

See the versioned papers for their evaluated protocol, ablations, and results.
Those historical experiments are not performance claims for the current V3.7
runtime or a cross-vendor comparison.
